## Google Sheets Email Automation with Power Automate RPA

### Overview

This project provides a workflow solution to automate email sending directly from Google Sheets using Power Automate RPA. By integrating Google Sheets and Power Automate, you can streamline the process of sending personalized emails to multiple recipients without manual intervention. This eliminates repetitive tasks, saves time, and enhances productivity.

### How It Works

1. Create a Google Sheet with the following columns:
   - Name: Name of the recipient.
   - Email id: Email address of the recipient.
   - Subject: Subject of the email.
   - Text: Content of the email.
   - Date: Date for when the email should be sent.

2. Populate the Google Sheet with recipient details, including their names, email addresses, email subject, email content, and the desired date for sending the email.

3. Set up Power Automate RPA to trigger the email sending process:
   - Configure the flow to retrieve data from the Google Sheet.
   - Use the retrieved data to generate personalized emails.
   - Connect to an email service provider (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) to send the emails.

4. Manually trigger the flow by clicking the "Run" button in Power Automate.

5. Power Automate will fetch the recipient details from the Google Sheet based on the specified date.

6. The flow will initiate the email sending process, sending personalized emails to the corresponding email addresses.
